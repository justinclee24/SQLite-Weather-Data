## Summary
Considering the results of this analysis, it seems that temperature over the year (relative to the two summary stats tables) is rather consistent. The low temps are rather moderate and the highs are expected from a vacation spot. The average temp between June and December are in the same ballpark (low to mid 70s) which would most likely be preferrable conditions for an ice cream/surf shop. Based on the overall results of this particular analysis, W. Avy should give the green light for this venture. Regarding other ways we could analyze the viability of the venture, you could also take a look a rainfall for the months of June and December with two separate queries, which have been performed. As seen in the table below, June's precipitation is quite low with a mean of 0.136in, a low of 0, and high of 4.43in. December had a bit higher of statistics regarding rainful, however, the month's numbers still are quite moderate. According to the chart, its lowest value was 0, highest being 6.42in, and average rainfall of 0.2168in. This isn't a terrible accumulation of rainfall, however, it would be worth looking further into wind and cloudiness as well.
